This is a programming language interpreter that is used to interprete my own programming language.

The language doesnt have a name yet.

Some parts of the programming language don´t work on Windows. They are supposed to be used on GNU systems. They might woirk on Unix systems. Feel free to add Windows or Unix support as i will not do that myself.

I am working on splitting the interpreter into multiple scripts, so that some functions can be imported so the interpreter runs faster because it doesn´t have to check for the other functions.

It is relatively slow as it needs to check for every variable and function in the function and var lists.
