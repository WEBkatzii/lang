# How to contribute to this Repo
Thank you for wanting to contribute to thios project


**1: Always create Pull-Request**

Please always create a new  branch and a Pull-Request
We want to ensure that the software in the main-branch always works
We don´t want to say we don´t trust your code, but it might break with other changes made to the main-branch
Please name the new branch after the ferature you added or after your commit name


**2: Please describe all changes so we can understand what your code is supposed to do**

We just want to easily know what your code is supposed to do.
When you don´t describe your code correctly, it might make us think the code isn´t doping what it is supposed to do


**3: Please add non-essential features as a library**

Not all People want to use all the features, but having to check for all features would also slow down the interpreter#
By adding your features as a librarty we can ensuere faster code execution
You also don´t import librarys you dont use, so don´t add non-essential features to the main-library


**4: Keep it short**

Please dont write massive comments or a commit-descriptionlong as a book
Most changes should be described in less then ten sentences
Bigger czhanges or new libraries might need more, but just try to keep it short
